# 🍋 Biologically Powered Low-Pass Filter

### 🚀 Overview  
This project demonstrates how **biological energy sources** (like lemon cells) can be used to power an **analog low-pass filter** circuit.  
It merges the concepts of **sustainable energy** and **analog electronics**, showing that even naturally generated voltage can drive a functioning op-amp circuit.

### ⚙️ Project Description  
The circuit is designed using a **low-power MCP602 operational amplifier**, powered by **lemon batteries** connected in series.  
The lemons act as **bio-voltaic cells**, generating voltage through electrochemical reactions between metal electrodes inserted into each fruit.  

The op-amp is configured as a **low-pass filter**, allowing low-frequency signals to pass while attenuating high frequencies.  
An **LED indicator** connected at the output shows when the filtered signal is active, proving the successful working of the bio-powered circuit.

### 🔬 Working Principle  

1. Multiple lemons are connected in series to generate ~2.7–3 V.  
2. The generated voltage powers the **op-amp-based low-pass filter**.  
3. The filter allows low-frequency signals to pass through while attenuating high-frequency noise.  
4. The filtered signal is used to drive an LED, providing a visible output.  

This demonstrates how **natural biological energy** can be effectively integrated into a simple analog circuit.
